# Project 3: Reinforcement Learning

![](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/assets/images/value.png)<br>

## Introduction
<p>In this project, you will implement value iteration and Q-learning. You will test your agents first on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.
<br>
As in previous projects, this project includes an autograder for you to grade your solutions on your machine. This can be run on all questions with the command:<br>

```bash
python autograder.py
```

</p>
<br>

## File Changed
Files to Edit and Submit: we will fill in portions of `valueIterationAgents.py`, `analysis.py` and `qlearningAgents.py` during the assignment. <br>
All of the files and codes in [Code directory](https://github.com/hajrezvan/Pacman-project/tree/master/P3/Code).
