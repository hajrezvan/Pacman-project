# Project 4: Ghostbusters

![](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/assets/images/busters.png)<br>
> All those colored walls, Mazes give Pacman the blues, So teach him to search.

## Introduction
<p>Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things were not always so. Legend has it that many years ago, Pacman’s great grandfather Grandpac learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However, he was blinded by his power and could only track ghosts by their banging and clanging.
<br>
In this project, you will design Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. You’ll advance from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency. <br>
</p>

## File Changed
We will fill in portions of ``bustersAgents.py`` and ``inference.py`` during the assignment. <br>
All of the files and codes in [Code directory](https://github.com/hajrezvan/Pacman-project/tree/master/P4/Code).
