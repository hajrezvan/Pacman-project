# Project 2: Multi-Agent Search

![](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/assets/images/pacman_multi_agent.png)<br>
> Pacman, now with ghosts.Minimax, Expectimax, Evaluation

## Introduction
<p>In this project, you will design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, you will implement both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design.
<br>
The code base has not changed much from the previous project, but please start with a fresh installation, rather than intermingling files from project 1.
<br>
As in Project 1, this project includes an autograder for you to grade your answers on your machine. This can be run on all questions with the command: <br>

```bash
python autograder.py
```

Note: If your `python` refers to Python 2.7, you may need to invoke `python3 autograder.py` <br>
</p>
<br>

## File Changed
We will fill in portions of ``multiAgents.py``  during the assignment. <br>
All of the files and codes in [Code directory](https://github.com/hajrezvan/Pacman-project/tree/master/P2/Code).
