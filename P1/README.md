# Project 1: Search

![](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/assets/images/maze.png)<br>
> All those colored walls, Mazes give Pacman the blues, So teach him to search.

## Introduction
<p>In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.
<br>
As in the Coding Diagnostic, this project includes an autograder for you to grade your answers on your machine. This can be run with the command: <br>

```bash
python autograder.py
```

See the autograder tutorial in the Coding Diagnostic for more information about using the autograder. <br>
